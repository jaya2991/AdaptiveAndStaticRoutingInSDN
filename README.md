# AdaptiveAndStaticRoutingInSDN
This project contains openly available Ryu controller.
I've made modifications to this controller.
1) I've written a module which is invoked everytime when controller receives a port statistics reply from a switch and handles the reply given by the switch.
2) Also implemented static and adaptive routing policies.
